# UoM Password changer

UoM enforces a passsword policy that requires users to periodically change their
passwords.

While this might seem like a good idea from a security perspective, in practice
it encorages bad passwords, and users to work around the policy.

A great quote from the article [_Time to rethink mandatory password changes_](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/techftc/2016/03/time-rethink-mandatory-password-changes)
describes the issue:

> I go on to explain that there is a lot of evidence to suggest that users who
> are required to change their passwords frequently select weaker passwords to
> begin with, and then change them in predictable ways that attackers can guess
> easily. Unless there is reason to believe a password has been compromised or
> shared, requiring regular password changes may actually do more harm than good
> in some cases. (And even if a password has been compromised, changing the
> password may be ineffective, especially if other steps arenâ€™t taken to correct
> security problems.)

This script works by changing your password randomly 10 times, before resetting
your password back to your original password, and thereby allowing you to reuse
your existing, non-weak password that you can remember.

## Using the script

This script requires Python (2.7 or 3+) with the requests library, and takes no
arguments, but will prompt for details.
